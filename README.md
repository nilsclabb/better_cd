## A better cd for lazy people like me

I never liked the `cd` command. I never remember how to use it properly. So I made this. Makes my brain just be able to 
remember one command instead of two and then I can just use the arrow keys to navigate.

### Installation

```sh
cargo install better_cd
```

### Usage

```sh
cd+
```

### Keybindings

- `q`: quit
- `Esc`: quit
- `Left`: go to parent directory
- `Right`: go to selected directory
- `Down`: go to next directory
- `Up`: go to previous directory
- `Enter`: select directory
